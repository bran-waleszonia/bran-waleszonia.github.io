          <h2>Thanks for visiting and getting to know me!</h2>

          <p>
            Let me introduce myself real quick. My name is Brandon Waleszonia and was born and raised in Central Arkansas.
            I attended Sheridan High School located in Sheridan, Arkansas. I would have graduated in 2006 but went ahead
            and obtained my G.E.D.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2008, I enlisted into the United States Army, as an infantryman, and attended One Station Unit Training
            (Basic and AIT together) at Fort Benning, Georgia. I would graduate around July of 2008, and ship to my first
            duty station, Fort Myer, Virgina. I spent 4 years stationed there, and performed numerous ceremonies, and final
            honors within Arlington National Cemetery. I eventually volunteered to become a Tomb Guard at the Tomb of the
            Unknown Soldier and earned my Tomb Guard Identification Badge,
            <a href="https://tombguard.org/guards/form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Badge #589</strong></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            My next assignment was at Fort Campbell, Kentucky with the 101st Airborne Division. I finished out my contract
            there and left service and moved back to Arkansas. I started going to school, first as a pre nursing student
            but changed my major and started delving into coding and IT related course. Life happened and I ended up leaving
            school and working full time. From healthcare, electrical work, law enforcement and security. I've now decided
            to jump back in and try to switch careers and this is my first step.
          </p>

          <p>
            I appreciate you reading my short biography, and come follow along with me on this journey!
