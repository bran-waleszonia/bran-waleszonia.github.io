        <p>
          Let me introduce myself real quick. My name is Brandon Waleszonia and was born and raised in Central Arkansas.
          I attended Sheridan High School located in Sheridan, Arkansas. I would have graduated in 2006 but went ahead
          and obtained my G.E.D.

          In 2008, I enlisted into the United States Army, as an infantryman, and attended One Station Unit Training
          (Basic and AIT together) at Fort Benning, Georgia. I would graduate around July of 2008, and ship to my first
          duty station, Fort Myer, Virgina. I spent 4 years stationed there, and performed numerous ceremonies, and final
          honors within Arlington National Cemetery. I eventually volunteered to become a Tomb Guard at the Tomb of the
          Unknown Soldier and earned my Tomb Guard Identification Badge,
          <a href="https://tombguard.org/guards/form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Badge #589</strong></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My next assignment was at Fort Campbell, Kentucky with the 101st Airborne Division. I finished out my contract
          there and left service and moved back to Arkansas. I started going to school, first as a pre nursing student
          but changed my major and started delving into coding and IT related course. Life happened and I ended up leaving
          school and working full time. From healthcare, electrical work, law enforcement and security. I've now decide
          to jump back in and try to switch careers and this is my first step.
